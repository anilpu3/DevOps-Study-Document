Passwordless remote connection
==============================================

public key - which s public to everyone.
private key - which s secured or confidential to the respective machine.

public key and private key location
ls -a : lists all the files along wit the hidden files.

look for the .ssh dir/folder
get inside the folder
cd .ssh
ls
u will find two files
1> authorized_keys 
2> known_hosts

cat the two files and check
if you cat the authorized_keys, u wil find the public key.
and
if u cat the known_hosts, you wil find the saved remote keys, which you had used to connect earlier. So, whenever you connect to the remote machine, 
u wil find the keys saved in the file known_hosts.

how to connect the remote machine without a password (passwordless connection) ?
we would generate a public and private key in one machine (user1) and wil copy and paste the public key of this machine (user1) to a authorized keys file 
of another machine (user2).

ssh-keygen (generates public and private key)
once the keys are generated, get to the location/path, you wil find two files under that directory.
1> id_rsa	(private key)
2> id_rsa.pub	(public key)

u can cat both the files and check.
to make passwordless connection, we will hav to copy the public key (id_rsa.pub)(user1) and paste it in the authorized_keys file 
of another machine (user2).

make sure all the space are removed before pastin the public key (user1) to the authorized_key file (user2) - copy and paste the public key in a notepad, remove
all the space and den copy it to the authorized_key file.

vi authorized_key (user2) - if you find a differnt key in the file then,go to the end of the line and enter, in a new line paste the public key of (user1), save and exit.
go to user1 and connect to user2 through ssh
ssh user2@ipaddress
 
Note - if the .ssh dir/folder doesn't exists, you can create a new folder(.ssh) and file in it (aithorized_keys) and copy the public key(id_rsa.pub) 
to authorized_key file of another machine.
