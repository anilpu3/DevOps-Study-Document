Branchin Strategy
Branches can be created for multiple reason. here we create branches for releases.
we follow git flow as a strategy. in our strategy, we have branches like master, feature,
hotfix, release and dev branch.
Feature branch - the developers wil create there own feature branch and merge the changes into the dev branch.
release branch - is used to maintian the releases.
hotfix fix branch - used to delever critical fix to the production environment.
master - it is a copy of production environment. it s always a clean branch.
development will be goin on in dev branch. once the code s ready for first release in dev branch, we will create a 
separate branch for first release and make release from release branch.
whatever issue we hav in the first release will be fixed in first release branch.
parallel development will be going on in dev branch for second release. once the code s ready for the second release
in dev branch. before we create release 2 branch, we would merge the first release into the dev banch and then we wil create
release 2 branch for second release 
whatever issue seen in the first release will not be present in the second release.
