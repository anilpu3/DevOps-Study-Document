KMS - Key Management Systems
2 types
1> Symmetric
2> Asymmetric

Symmetric 
CMK - Customer Master Key
	1> Usin CMK through AWS CLI, will generate
		1> Plaintext Key 
		2> Cipher Encrypted key
	2> Both the Keys has to be decodded as both the keys are encoded with base65
	3> Encrypt the data usin Plaintext Key
	4> Delete the Plaintext Key.
	5> To decrypt the data
		1> Use Cipher Encrpted Key to generate the Plaintext Key.
		2> Decode the Plaintext Key.
		3> Use the Plaintext Key to Decrypt the data.

Creating KMS data keys

1) Command to create Plaintext data key and Encrypted data key
	 aws kms generate-data-key --key-id alias/demokey --key-spec AES_256 --region us-east-1
note: - demokey is the name of the CMS whcih we created in AWS console

2) Once after both keys are generated, save them in separate file. But before saving them we need to decode them 
because they are encoded with base64 format.
	ex: - echo "Plaintext data key" | base64 --decode >  file_name
Do this for both Plaintext data key and ciphertext data.

3) Now encrypt the file which u want to encrypt usign following command and save the output in another file name
 	openssl enc -in ./file_name_to_be_encrypted -out ./ouput_file_name_afterencrypted -e -aes256 -k fileb://./planidatakey_name

4) Now delete the Plaintext data key and file which contains the sensitive data.

5) Now if we want to see our encrypted data, then we need to decrypt it. But we don't have Plaintext data key,
so we need to call KMS to generate Plaintext data key by using encrypted data key which is created in the step 1.
	aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://./encrypted-datakey --region us-east-1
This will create the Plaintext data key once agian.

6) Again we need to decode it by base64 formate
	ex: - echo "Plaintext data key" | base64 --decode >  file_name

7) Now we need to dcrypt the encrypted data using following command and then we can see our original data.
	openssl enc -in ./file_name_to_be_dcrypted -out ./ouput_file_name_afterdcrypted -d -aes256 -k fileb://./plaindatakey_name


To convert a base64 format data decode and encode in linux and windows
Linux
 Encode a data file to Base64
base64 data.txt > data.b64

 Decode a Base64 file
base64 -d data.b64 > data.txt


Windows
 Encode a data file to Base64
certutil -encode data.txt tmp.b64 && findstr /v /c:- tmp.b64 > data.b64

 Decode a Base64 file
certutil -decode data.b64 data.txt
